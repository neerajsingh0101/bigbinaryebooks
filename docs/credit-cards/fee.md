# Fee

Let's say that John bought coffee for the entire office and it cost him $100. He swiped his credit card at Starbucks and paid $100. On the credit card statement, John will see a charge of $100.00.

However, Starbucks will not get the full $100.00. Depending on what kind of rate is negotiated between Starbucks and his merchant account (Chase Bank in this case), Starbucks might have to pay anywhere between 2% to 3% of the transaction amount. Letâ€™s say that the rate was 2%. That means Starbucks receives $98.00. What happens to the $2.00? That is divided between the bank that issued the credit card to John (Wells Fargo in this case), Visa and the merchant account ( Chase bank in this case). This $2.00 fee is also called "merchant discount".

The credit card issuing bank takes the biggest chunk of the fee. It could be as high as $1.75 of the $2.00 fee.  The fee taken by the credit card issuing bank is called an "interchange fee".  It might seem like the "interchange fee" should be dictated by the credit card issuing bank. However, the "interchange fee" is set by Visa or Mastercard and it is non-negotiable. The "interchange fee" is always made up of a flat rate for each transaction plus a percentage of the transaction amount. In the USA, the interchange fee is usually around 1.77% + $0.10 per transaction.

About $0.18 of the $2.00 fee is taken by Visa or Mastercard. This is called "assessments fee".

The remaining $0.07 is taken by the merchant account provider. This is what is negotiable when a business is looking for a merchant account. The next chapter has more information about how to go about finding the best credit card processor.

How much money a business pays in card processing fees also depends on many other factors. One of the most important factors is whether the transaction type was "card present" or "card not present". "Card present" is when the card holder physically swipes his card like John did when he bought coffee at Starbucks. "Card not present" is when the card numbers are keyed in either through a telephone or through a website. When John bought a book online the transaction was called "card not present".

Since there is more risk of fraud when the card is not present, businesses have to pay more towards credit card processing fees for online transactions compared to their counterparts where customers swipe their credit cards.

Also the industry type matters. The fraud rate is generally higher for the touring , gambling and adult entertainment business. The business owners of these types of companies will pay higher credit card processing fees.


# Interchange Fee

Interchange fee is the largest portion of the total fee. Both Visa and Mastercard have published a very complex set of rules which dictate the fee conditions and rates.  Below is the interchange fee rulebook published by [mastercard](http://bigbinary.com/pdfs/MasterCard_Interchange_Rates_and_Criteria.pdf) and [Visa](http://bigbinary.com/pdfs/april-2011-visa-usa-interchange-rate-sheet.pdf) .


# Assessments Fee

This is a small fee Visa and Mastercard charge for using their network. Both Visa and Mastercard have set assessments fee to be 0.11% of the transaction amount.

Mastercard charges an additional fee of 0.0185% of the transaction amount. They call it Network and Brand Usage Fee (NABU).

Visa also has an additional fee of 0.0195% of the transaction amount. They call it Acquirer Processing Fee (APF).

# Processor Fee

This is the fee a processor charges for using their services. Usually they have fees attached with each type of service they offer.
Some of the common fees are:

* Setup fee (one time)
* Monthly maintenance fee
* Statement fee
* Address Verification (AVS) Fee
