# Swiping A Credit Card for Coffee

John has a Visa credit card in his wallet. This credit card has been issued to him by Wells Fargo Bank.
Today, he is going to buy coffee at the local Starbucks. Coffee costs $4.00 so John swipes his credit card at the credit card reader.

When John swipes his card, the card reader grabs the credit card number and other information from the magnetic bar and sends that information to the Starbucks Merchant Account (more on this coming up). Let's assume that the Starbucks Merchant Account is with Chase Bank. The card reader sends the card information to Chase Bank. Chase Bank forwards that information to the credit card's issuing bank which happens to be Wells Fargo Bank. When Wells Fargo Bank receives the request, it verifies that John has sufficient funds in his account and then Wells Fargo Bank sends a response to Chase Bank stating that the request was approved. Chase Bank, in turn, forwards that response to the card reader and finally a receipt is printed for John, who walks away with his coffee and the receipt.

In short, the following things happened when John swiped his card:

* Card reader grabs the information from the card.
* Card reader forwards a request to Chase Bank.
* Chase Bank forwards the request to Wells Fargo Bank via the "Visa interchange and settlement system".
* Chase Bank forwards the request to Wells Fargo Bank.
* Wells Fargo Bank verifies that John has sufficient funds.
* Wells Fargo sends a success response to Chase Bank.
* Chase Bank forwards the success response to the card reader.

All those transactions occur in less than 3 seconds. Amazing! Right?
